# Facial-Emotion-Detection
### Introduction
The introduction of deep neural neural network by Geoffrey Hinton and others have unlocked computers to commit various tasks which were deemed impossible in the post neural network era. Computer applications can now identify the state of the emotion its user is going through with the analysis of the user faces and therefore generate contents accordingly. Just like a human being, with a perfectly and accurately trained model, these systems can finally receive a basic cognition ability called emotion recognition. Therefore this project, which was aims to perfect a Convolutional Neural Network which shall enable a system to accurately determine the emotion of its user using the system camera. This project has been demonstrated in the 3rd ICDCIT Technovision 2019 organised by School of Computer Engineering, Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar and achieved multiple incentives.
### Execution
1. Install the required libraries and its dependencies.
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. Train the given model. `python3 train.py`
3. Execute the emotion detection script. `python3 detection.py`

### Source of Data
The model makes use of FER2013 dataset.
